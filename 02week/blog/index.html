    <aside>
      <p>“Never forget what you are, for surely the world will not. Make it your strength. Then it can never be your weakness. Armour yourself in it, and it will never be used to hurt you.”
      <br>― George R.R. Martin, A Game of Thrones</p>
      <p>“Winter is coming.”
      <br>― George R.R. Martin, A Game of Thrones
    </p>
    <p>“The man who passes the sentence should swing the sword. If you would take a man's life, you owe it to him to look into his eyes and hear his final words. And if you cannot bear to do that, then perhaps the man does not deserve to die.”
      <br>― George R.R. Martin, A Game of Thrones</p>
